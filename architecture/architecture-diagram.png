# Architecture Diagram Description

# Components & Data Flow
	1. Internet Users
    ↳ Access the application through the Application Load Balancer (ALB) DNS name.
	2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
		○ Internet-facing ALB
		○ Listens on HTTP (80) / HTTPS (443)
		○ Distributes incoming traffic to healthy EC2 instances.
	3. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
		○ Protects the ALB by inspecting and filtering malicious traffic and bots.
	4. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
		○ Automatically manages EC2 instances based on demand.
		○ Uses a Launch Template with a custom AMI that contains Ubuntu + Nginx.
		○ Maintains desired instance count (min:1, desired:2, max:4).
		○ Instances spread across multiple Availability Zones.
	5. EC2 Instances (Ubuntu + Nginx)
		○ Serve the web content.
		○ Based on the custom AMI configured earlier.
	6. Launch Template
		○ Contains AMI ID and instance configuration used by ASG.
	7. Networking
		○ Instances and ALB reside within a VPC.
		○ Instances deployed in multiple public subnets for high availability.
# Security Groups allow SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) as appropriate.
